# Mayora Company Profile Website (Remake)

## Overview 

<p align="justify">The first time I learned about Laravel framework, I wanted to create a web app with bigger scale than just a landing page clone. Then comes the idea of creating a company profile web app with an extra feature such as Content Management System (CMS) and admin Dashboard. I decided to create the clone web app with my own design & style. Even though there are lots of room for improvement to do, I wanted to showcase the web app and hope to improve the app overtime in the future. Feel free to clone this repo for any kind of use, and DM me for any question or discussion. Thank you üíñ</p>

## Features 
- <b>Company Profile</b>: Contains every publicly shared information about 'Mayora'.

    - Update Account: Edit/Delete an existing account as an admin.
